Biometrics in an airport environment can provide a contactless way
of identity verification. U.S. Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) has been trialling and implementing the Biometric Entry Exit
Program at U.S. Customs and Border Control (CBP). Using the
Traveller Verification System (TVS), the program biometrically
confirms the traveller's identity and their entry or exit, with an
increased ability to detect fraudulent documents and visa overstays.
This paper assesses the Biometric Exit Program to analyse the use of
biometrics at airports and identify the challenges faced. An analysis
is conducted on the Entry Exit Program at Dublin Airport, including
facial recognition boarding gates. Pilot test results from Dublin
Airport and other U.S. airports are used to identify challenges.
These included a gap in stakeholder support, low biometric
matching rate, infrastructure and network connectivity issues,
privacy concerns amongst travellers, and heavy reliance on airlines.
Recommendations and solutions for advancement are provided.
